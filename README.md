# MyAuthenticationStateProvider

This is a server-side Blazor application I wrote to see how Visual Studio 2022 creates a new app with authentication. Note: because I wanted to include authentication, the only choice VS 2022 gave me with Individual Accounts.

## .NET version

This is written using .NET 9.
